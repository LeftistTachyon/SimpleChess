This project is the next iteration of my chess project.  
## Getting started  
Please take a look at our [contributing guidlines](../master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Contributor Code of Conduct](../master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  
Also, [this Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is very helpful.  
A great place to start is the [issues page](https://github.com/LeftistTachyon/SimpleChess/issues). Following the contributing guidlines can help guide you through making your first contribution to this project.  
## TODO  
The _TODO_ list is essentially kept on the [projects page](https://github.com/LeftistTachyon/SimpleChess/projects). There is one for [the client side](https://github.com/LeftistTachyon/SimpleChess/projects/1) and one for [the server side](https://github.com/LeftistTachyon/SimpleChess/projects/2).
