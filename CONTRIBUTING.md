## I want to contribute code  
 * Choose an issue to start work on. All issues can be found [here](https://github.com/LeftistTachyon/SimpleChess/issues). The ones marked [good first issue](https://github.com/LeftistTachyon/SimpleChess/labels/good%20first%20issue) are a good place to start.  
 * Once finished, start a pull request with your branch of code. Your code will be reviewed and hopefully merged.  
## I want to report a bug or problem
[**Make an issue.**](https://github.com/LeftistTachyon/SimpleChess/issues/new) However, keep in mind that issues that provide little value compared to the required work may be closed. Before posting an issue, ensure that:  
 1. it is reproducible.  
 2. it is not a duplicate. [The advanced search syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) might help.  
 3. it is not trivial or require a lot of time to fix.
